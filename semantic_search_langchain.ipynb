      "in the mid-21st century, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. joseph cooper, a widowed engineer and former nasa pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law donald, son tom, and daughter murphy. living in a post-truth society, cooper is reprimanded for telling murphy that the apollo missions were not fake; he encourages her to carefully observe and record what she sees. they discover that dust patterns, which murphy first attributes to a ghost, result from gravity variations, and translate into geographic coordinates. these lead them to a secret nasa facility headed by cooper's former supervisor, professor john brand, who explains that 48 years earlier a wormhole appeared near saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named gargantua. volunteers had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with miller, edmunds, and mann reporting back desirable results. brand explains he has conceived two plans to ensure humanity’s survival - plan a involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory, allowing a mass exodus from earth, while plan b is a conventional launch of the endurance spacecraft with 5,000 frozen embryos to colonize a habitable planet. cooper is recruited to pilot the endurance. when murphy refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns. the crew consists of cooper, the robots tars and case, and the scientists dr. amelia brand, (professor brand's daughter), romilly, and doyle. after traversing the wormhole, cooper, doyle, and brand use a lander to investigate miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. after landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. by the time the engines restart, 23 years have elapsed in terms of earth time. having enough fuel for only one of the other two planets, cooper rules they go to mann's, as he is still broadcasting. en route, they receive messages from earth. murphy cooper is now a scientist working on plan a. on his deathbed, professor brand reveals to her that plan b was his only real plan, knowing that plan a required observations of gravitational singularities from within a black hole. on mann's planet, the endurance crew revive mann from cryostasis. he assures them colonization is possible, despite an extreme environment. on an excursion, mann attempts to kill cooper and reveals that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. he steals cooper's lander and heads for the endurance. while a booby trap set by mann kills romilly, brand rescues cooper with the other lander and they race to the endurance. mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the endurance. through a difficult docking maneuver, cooper regains control. with insufficient fuel, they resort to a slingshot around gargantua which costs them another 51 years. in the process, cooper and tars must jettison their landers to allow brand and case to reach edmunds' planet. slipping past the event horizon of gargantua, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract, possibly constructed by humans of the far future. across time, cooper can see through the bookcases of murphy's old room on earth and weakly interact with its gravity. realizing that he is now murphy's \"ghost\", he manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, transmitting via morse code the quantum data that tars collected from inside the event horizon. the tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects cooper and tars. cooper wakes on a huge station, orbiting saturn. he reunites with murphy, now an old woman nearing death. using the quantum data, she was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory, enabling humanity’s exodus and transformation into an advanced spacefaring civilization. she reminds cooper that amelia brand is out there alone. cooper and tars take a spacecraft to rejoin brand and case, who are setting up a human colony on edmunds' habitable planet.\n"

Joseph Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald, son Tom, and daughter Murphy. Living in a post-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded for telling Murphy that the Apollo missions were not fake; he encourages her to carefully observe and record what she sees. They discover that dust patterns, which Murphy first attributes to a ghost, result from gravity variations, and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Cooper's former supervisor, Professor John Brand, who explains that 48 years earlier a wormhole appeared near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results. Brand explains he has conceived two plans to ensure humanity’s survival - Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory, allowing a mass exodus from Earth, while Plan B is a conventional launch of the Endurance spacecraft with 5,000 frozen embryos to colonize a habitable planet. Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance. When Murphy refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns.\\r\\nThe crew consists of Cooper, the robots TARS and CASE, and the scientists Dr. Amelia Brand, (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle. After traversing the wormhole, Cooper, Doyle, and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. By the time the engines restart, 23 years have elapsed in terms of Earth time.\\r\\nHaving enough fuel for only one of the other two planets, Cooper rules they go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting. En route, they receive messages from Earth. Murphy Cooper is now a scientist working on Plan A. On his deathbed, Professor Brand reveals to her that Plan B was his only real plan, knowing that Plan A required observations of gravitational singularities from within a black hole.\\r\\nOn Mann's planet, the Endurance crew revive Mann from cryostasis. He assures them colonization is possible, despite an extreme environment. On an excursion, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance. Through a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control.\\r\\nWith insufficient fuel, they resort to a slingshot around Gargantua which costs them another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and TARS must jettison their landers to allow Brand and CASE to reach Edmunds' planet. Slipping past the event horizon of Gargantua, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract, possibly constructed by humans of the far future. Across time, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Realizing that he is now Murphy's \"ghost\", he manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, transmitting via Morse code the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon.\\r\\nThe tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes on a huge station, orbiting Saturn. He reunites with Murphy, now an old woman nearing death. Using the quantum data, she was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory, enabling humanity’s exodus and transformation into an advanced spacefaring civilization. She reminds Cooper that Amelia Brand is out there alone. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up a human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.  in the mid-21st century, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. joseph cooper, a widowed engineer and former nasa pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law donald, son tom, and daughter murphy. living in a post-truth society, cooper is reprimanded for telling murphy that the apollo missions were not fake; he encourages her to carefully observe and record what she sees. they discover that dust patterns, which murphy first attributes to a ghost, result from gravity variations, and translate into geographic coordinates. these lead them to a secret nasa facility headed by cooper's former supervisor, professor john brand, who explains that 48 years earlier a wormhole appeared near saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named gargantua. volunteers had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with miller, edmunds, and mann reporting back desirable results. brand explains he has conceived two plans to ensure humanity’s survival - plan a involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory, allowing a mass exodus from earth, while plan b is a conventional launch of the endurance spacecraft with 5,000 frozen embryos to colonize a habitable planet. cooper is recruited to pilot the endurance. when murphy refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns. the crew consists of cooper, the robots tars and case, and the scientists dr. amelia brand, (professor brand's daughter), romilly, and doyle. after traversing the wormhole, cooper, doyle, and brand use a lander to investigate miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. after landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. by the time the engines restart, 23 years have elapsed in terms of earth time. having enough fuel for only one of the other two planets, cooper rules they go to mann's, as he is still broadcasting. en route, they receive messages from earth. murphy cooper is now a scientist working on plan a. on his deathbed, professor brand reveals to her that plan b was his only real plan, knowing that plan a required observations of gravitational singularities from within a black hole. on mann's planet, the endurance crew revive mann from cryostasis. he assures them colonization is possible, despite an extreme environment. on an excursion, mann attempts to kill cooper and reveals that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. he steals cooper's lander and heads for the endurance. while a booby trap set by mann kills romilly, brand rescues cooper with the other lander and they race to the endurance. mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the endurance. through a difficult docking maneuver, cooper regains control. with insufficient fuel, they resort to a slingshot around gargantua which costs them another 51 years. in the process, cooper and tars must jettison their landers to allow brand and case to reach edmunds' planet. slipping past the event horizon of gargantua, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract, possibly constructed by humans of the far future. across time, cooper can see through the bookcases of murphy's old room on earth and weakly interact with its gravity. realizing that he is now murphy's \"ghost\", he manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, transmitting via morse code the quantum data that tars collected from inside the event horizon. the tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects cooper and tars. cooper wakes on a huge station, orbiting saturn. he reunites with murphy, now an old woman nearing death. using the quantum data, she was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory, enabling humanity’s exodus and transformation into an advanced spacefaring civilization. she reminds cooper that amelia brand is out there alone. cooper and tars take a spacecraft to rejoin brand and case, who are setting up a human colony on edmunds' habitable planet.

      "based on the 2001 version. the 1999 version has never been released on home video on any market. in southeast asian, an archaeological party explore some caverns underground. dr. campbell and dr. hughes are the two leaders of the archaeological expedition, and get separated. while dr. hughes finds an alien corpse with a fossilized diamond, campbell finds hieroglyphics at the cost of the party except for hughes and himself. two years later, an alien mothership arrives near earth’s orbit, which destroys two american satellites that gets the attention of parker, who reports it to general murdock of the united national defense agency (unda). bud black, a cameraman, learns from a colleague about a dinosaur dig, led by campbell along with his assistant holly. dr. hughes, who has been believed to be dead for the last two years, shows up at the dig site to warn campbell but is quickly removed from the site. subsequently, the alien ship sends beams to reanimate the dinosaur but at the cost of some of the diggers’ lives. holly confronts campbell about the mysterious deaths and quits after campbell refuses to launch an investigation. dr. hughes manages to find holly and reveals to her about the legend of yonggary, the alien fossil, additional hieroglyphics, and that he has been held by the us government as a \"guest\" for the last two years. she dismisses his claims at first but comes around after he shows her classified data concerning the alien fossil. they return to the dig site to stop campbell but arrive too late when the alien ship sends one final beam that fully resurrects yonggary, killing campbell in the process. the alien ship dematerializes yonggary and holly and dr. hughes are taken into custody by parker. yonggary is then teleported right before them and manage to escape before a helicopter squadron engage yonggary in battle, only to be defeated. the national space investigation agency (nsia) sends stanley mills to share information regarding the aliens with general murdock and general howell. mills explains that a paleontologist provided the nsia with scientific evidence that an alien civilization visited the earth 200 million years ago and that vital information in defeating the aliens was stolen. mills vouches in capturing the aliens alive but general howell wishes to destroy the aliens instead. yonggary is then teleported to a city and proceeds to go on a rampage. dr. hughes and holly arrive at the unda base, only to be confronted by mills, who reveals that dr. hughes was the paleontologist who shared his discoveries with the nsia and later stole information from their lab. dr. hughes counters that he told the nsia that the hieroglyphics were a warning and they chose to ignore them. mills attempts to take the stolen data disc back from dr. hughes but fails and attempts to leave but is forced to stay by general murdock. as the unda continues fighting yonggary, the president tells general murdock that he will give them five hours to destroy yonggary or a nuclear bomb will be dropped on the monster. looking at all their limited options, general murdock orders general thomas to dispatch his experimental project t forces to attack yonggary. dr. hughes and holly then decode the additional hieroglyphics and discover that the aliens are controlling yonggary through a diamond shaped receptor on his forehead and that \"another great light will be sent to do battle\". as parker and the t-forces battle yonggary, general murdock is then told by the president that he has sent the bombers to nuke yonggary, to the delight of mills. the t-forces then manage to break the aliens’ control over yonggary. mills tries to convince general murdock to destroy him but is ignored, which forces mills to jam the unda's radars unless they let him leave, however, mills fails and is then arrested. the aliens send a new monster, cyker,[note 1] to battle yonggary. cyker initially gets the upper hand but yonggary emerges victorious in the end, forcing the aliens to flee. the generals manage to successfully stop the bomber from dropping the nuke at the last minute and the following morning, the unda transports yonggary from the city to a deserted island.\n"

The bay doors open, releasing a Corvette. An astronaut seated in the car then begins descending through Earth's atmosphere, landing in a desert canyon.\\r\\nIn the framing story, the astronaut Grimaldi arrives at home, where he is greeted by his daughter. He says he has something to show her. When he opens his case, a green, crystalline sphere rises out and melts him. It introduces itself to the terrified girl as \"the sum of all evils\". Looking into the orb known as the Loc-Nar, the girl sees how it has influenced societies throughout time and space.\\r\\nIn a dystopian New York City in the year 2031, cynical taxicab driver Harry Canyon narrates his day in film-noir-style, grumbling about his fares and occasional robbery attempts, which he thwarts with a disintegrator installed behind his seat. He stumbles into an incident where he rescues a girl from a gangster named Rudnick, who had murdered the girl's father. She tells him about her father's discovery: the Loc-Nar, an artifact over which people are killing each other. Harry takes the girl back to his apartment, where she climbs into his bed and has sex with him. The next day, one of his fares is Rudnick, who threatens Harry if he does not cooperate. The girl decides to sell the Loc-Nar to Rudnick and split the proceeds with Harry. At the exchange, Rudnick takes the Loc-Nar out of its case and is disintegrated. Meanwhile, the girl informs Harry that she's keeping the money for herself and pulls a gun on him. Harry is forced to use his disintegrator on her. He keeps the money and writes it up as a \"two-day ride with one hell of a tip\".\\r\\nA nerdy teenager finds a \"green meteorite\" and puts it in his rock collection. During a lightning experiment, the orb hurls the boy into the world of Neverwhere, where he transforms into a naked, bald-headed muscular man called Den, an acronym for his earth name, David Ellis Norman. After getting a nearby article of clothing to keep anyone from seeing his \"dork\" hanging out, Den witnesses a strange ritual, rescuing a nubile young woman who was about to be sacrificed to Uhluhtc. Reaching safety, she introduces herself as Katherine Wells from the British colony of Gibraltar. While she demonstrates her gratitude with sexual favors, they are interrupted by the minions of Ard, an immortal man who wants to obtain the Loc-Nar for himself. He orders Den to get the Loc-Nar from the Queen, who performed the ritual. Den agrees and infiltrates the palace, but is promptly caught by the Queen, who offers leniency if he has sex with her. He complies distracting the Queen while the raiding party steals the Loc-Nar. Den escapes and races back to rescue Katherine from Ard. Recreating the lightning incident that drew him to Neverwhere, he is able to banish Ard and the Queen. Den's voice-over has him suspecting that they were teleported to his mom's house and she will be surprised. Refusing the opportunity to take the Loc-Nar for himself, Den rides with Katherine into the sunset content to remain in Neverwhere. As for the Loc-Nar, it rises into the sky and lands on a space station where it is picked up by someone.\\r\\nOn a space station, crooked space captain Lincoln F. Sternn is on trial for numerous serious charges presented by the prosecutor consisting of 12 accounts of murder on the first degree, 14 counts of armed theft of Federation property, 22 accounts of piracy in high space, 18 counts of fraud, 37 counts of rape, and one moving violation. Pleading \"not guilty\" against the advice of his lawyer Charlie, Sternn explains that he expects to be acquitted because he bribed a witness Hanover Fiste. Fiste takes the stand upon being called to the stand by the prosecutor, but his perjury is subverted when the Loc-Nar, now the size of a marble, causes him to blurt out the truth about Sternn's evil deeds. Fiste rants with such fury that he changes into a hulking muscular form and chases Sternn throughout the station, breaking through bulkheads and wreaking havoc. Eventually, he corners Sternn, receives his promised payoff, and promptly shrinks back to his gangly original form. Sternn opens a trap door under Fiste, ejecting him into space. The Loc-Nar enters Earth's atmosphere with Fiste's flaming hand still clinging to it.\\r\\nBecause of time constraints, a segment called \"Neverwhere Land\", which would have connected \"Captain Sternn\" to \"B-17\", was cut.\\r\\nThe story follows the influence of the Loc-Nar upon the evolution of a planet, from the Loc-Nar landing in a body of water, influencing the rise of the industrial age, and a world war.

Informing the pilot, he heads back to the cockpit, when the Loc-Nar rams itself into the plane and reanimates the dead crew members as zombies.

       "2000          Heavy Metal 2000  Canadian          Michel Lemire & Michael Coldewey  voices Michael Ironside, Billy Idol, Julie Strain, Sonja Ball  animated feature  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Metal_2000    In ages past, a malevolent race called the Arakacians discovered a place where space-time leaked a type of fluid. This fluid granted immortality to anyone who consumed it. The Arakacians built an empire and enslaved the known universe for centuries; they were unstoppable. The Arakacians were finally vanquished after the fountain chamber (where they gathered the water of life) was sealed by freedom fighters. The key to the chamber, a glowing crystal that will lead the bearer back to the fountain, but would drive anyone who possessed it insane, was cast into space and lost among the stars.\\r\\nIn a present-day asteroid excavation, space crewman Tyler and his colleague find the key by accident. Tyler touches the key and instantly goes insane. Tyler kills his mining partner, and takes over the ship, killing most of the resisting crew except for Dr. Schechter, and the pilots Lambert and Germain.[1] His search for the planet with the fountain leads to Eden,[2] a planet that is designated F.A.K.K.² (Federation-Assigned Ketogenic Killzone to the second level), but has inhabitants whose bodies carry the immortality fluid. Tyler invades Eden, and kills many of the Edenites, capturing some so he can extract the immortality fluids from their bodies. He also keeps the attractive Kerrie for his own sexual purposes. When Germain resists the idea, he is left on Eden.\\r\\nKerrie's beautiful sister Julie, who survived the attack, finds Germain and they team up to follow Tyler. At a renegade space station, Julie finds Tyler at a restaurant and critically injures him. However, he ingests a vial with the immortality serum and heals instantly.[1] In the ensuing gunfight, Tyler blows up the club. Julie escapes the explosion; she and Germain board a shuttle-craft that latches onto Tyler's ship with a tractor beam before it jumps into hyperspace. Discovering them mid-travel, Tyler tries to shake them off, but the fight causes the hyperspace to collapse and the two ships to crash.\\r\\nJulie wakes up on the desert planet called Oroboris, and meets a mysterious cloaked sage named Odin and his assistant, Zeek, a rock-like creature, both of whom are guardians of the ancient fountain. Elsewhere, Tyler's ship has been destroyed and most of his crew and abductees are dead. Tyler orders Dr. Schechter to extract Kerrie's fluids. He explores the planet and finds a race of reptilian beings, which he conquers by defeating their champion and then their leader in a death match. Julie enters the reptilian city in disguise as a woman that the reptiles found for Tyler. That night, she seduces Tyler, but when she tries to kill him, Zeek captures her and takes her back to Odin. Julie infiltrates Tyler's ship where she discovers Kerrie is still alive. She takes out Dr. Schechter, frees Kerrie, and escapes as the complex explodes. As a result, Tyler vows to make Julie immortal so he can \"screw her and kill her every hour of every day for all eternity\". With only three vials of serum, he orders his troops to storm the citadel where the immortality fountain is located.\\r\\nAt the citadel, Julie undergoes a ritual where she is outfitted in armor. She, Kerrie, and Germain help the fountain's guardians defend against Tyler's army. In the fighting, Lambert suffers a near-fatal injury and while reaching for Tyler's last vial of immortality serum, he knocks it loose from Tyler's belt and it breaks on the ground. Tyler, enraged, kills Lambert for the blunder. Tyler then walks to the pit of immortality and is about to put the crystal into the fountain's final lock but is stopped by Julie. She stabs Tyler in the left eye before he is able to place the crystal in the lock. A fight ensues, but Tyler appears to have the advantage, until Odin intervenes, which allows Julie to finally kill Tyler. After Tyler is left dead. Odin, throwing off his cloak, reveals himself to be the last of the Arakacians. He has been in hiding all these centuries, waiting for someone to find the chamber key and be drawn to the fountain. He intends to claim it as his own, and reestablish the Arakacian empire. However, Zeek pulls the crystal key from the pedestal, locking Odin inside the fountain chamber forever, and flies into outer space. As Germain and Kerrie help Julie to her feet, Zeek envelops the crystal into himself and becomes a new asteroid to hide the key for all time.[2]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  in ages past, a malevolent race called the arakacians discovered a place where space-time leaked a type of fluid. this fluid granted immortality to anyone who consumed it. the arakacians built an empire and enslaved the known universe for centuries; they were unstoppable. the arakacians were finally vanquished after the fountain chamber (where they gathered the water of life) was sealed by freedom fighters. the key to the chamber, a glowing crystal that will lead the bearer back to the fountain, but would drive anyone who possessed it insane, was cast into space and lost among the stars. in a present-day asteroid excavation, space crewman tyler and his colleague find the key by accident. tyler touches the key and instantly goes insane. tyler kills his mining partner, and takes over the ship, killing most of the resisting crew except for dr. schechter, and the pilots lambert and germain. his search for the planet with the fountain leads to eden, a planet that is designated f.a.k.k.² (federation-assigned ketogenic killzone to the second level), but has inhabitants whose bodies carry the immortality fluid. tyler invades eden, and kills many of the edenites, capturing some so he can extract the immortality fluids from their bodies. he also keeps the attractive kerrie for his own sexual purposes. when germain resists the idea, he is left on eden. kerrie's beautiful sister julie, who survived the attack, finds germain and they team up to follow tyler. at a renegade space station, julie finds tyler at a restaurant and critically injures him. however, he ingests a vial with the immortality serum and heals instantly. in the ensuing gunfight, tyler blows up the club. julie escapes the explosion; she and germain board a shuttle-craft that latches onto tyler's ship with a tractor beam before it jumps into hyperspace. discovering them mid-travel, tyler tries to shake them off, but the fight causes the hyperspace to collapse and the two ships to crash. julie wakes up on the desert planet called oroboris, and meets a mysterious cloaked sage named odin and his assistant, zeek, a rock-like creature, both of whom are guardians of the ancient fountain. elsewhere, tyler's ship has been destroyed and most of his crew and abductees are dead. tyler orders dr. schechter to extract kerrie's fluids. he explores the planet and finds a race of reptilian beings, which he conquers by defeating their champion and then their leader in a death match. julie enters the reptilian city in disguise as a woman that the reptiles found for tyler. that night, she seduces tyler, but when she tries to kill him, zeek captures her and takes her back to odin. julie infiltrates tyler's ship where she discovers kerrie is still alive. she takes out dr. schechter, frees kerrie, and escapes as the complex explodes. as a result, tyler vows to make julie immortal so he can \"screw her and kill her every hour of every day for all eternity\". with only three vials of serum, he orders his troops to storm the citadel where the immortality fountain is located. at the citadel, julie undergoes a ritual where she is outfitted in armor. she, kerrie, and germain help the fountain's guardians defend against tyler's army. in the fighting, lambert suffers a near-fatal injury and while reaching for tyler's last vial of immortality serum, he knocks it loose from tyler's belt and it breaks on the ground. tyler, enraged, kills lambert for the blunder. tyler then walks to the pit of immortality and is about to put the crystal into the fountain's final lock but is stopped by julie. she stabs tyler in the left eye before he is able to place the crystal in the lock. a fight ensues, but tyler appears to have the advantage, until odin intervenes, which allows julie to finally kill tyler. after tyler is left dead. odin, throwing off his cloak, reveals himself to be the last of the arakacians. he has been in hiding all these centuries, waiting for someone to find the chamber key and be drawn to the fountain. he intends to claim it as his own, and reestablish the arakacian empire. however, zeek pulls the crystal key from the pedestal, locking odin inside the fountain chamber forever, and flies into outer space. as germain and kerrie help julie to her feet, zeek envelops the crystal into himself and becomes a new asteroid to hide the key for all time.
