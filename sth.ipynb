They praised the performances of the cast, the emotional depth of the story, and the music by Pritam. However, some felt that the second half of the movie was a bit slow and lacked a smooth flow. Since the film is seen as a follow-up to Life in a... Metro (2007), many appreciated how it explored modern city relationships and emotional struggles. On Rotten Tomatoes, 64% of 14 critics gave it a positive rating, with an average score of 6 out of 10.[[16]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-Hindu-17)[[18]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-IndiaToday-18)\\n\\nThe performances by the actors stood out. Pankaj Tripathi and Konkona Sen Sharma were praised for showing the ups and downs of a middle-aged couple. The Hindu called their chemistry “electric” and liked how their scenes balanced humor and emotions.[[17]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-Hindu-17) Anupam Kher and Neena Gupta’s story was described as “warm, witty, and touching” by News18.[[19]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-News18-19) Fatima Sana Shaikh and Ali Fazal’s storyline received appreciation for its emotional depth, although The Times of India noted that their arc required tighter writing.[[20]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-TOI-20)\\n\\nSara Ali Khan’s role as Chumki received mixed reactions. Hindustan Times called her a “show-stealer,” while Rediff.com felt her performance was affected by styling choices and tone issues.[[21]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-HT-21)[[22]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-Rediff-22) Aditya Roy Kapur was liked for his charm, but some critics thought his role wasn’t well developed.[[20]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-TOI-20)\\n\\nThe music by Pritam got a lot of praise and was considered a key part of the film’s feel and storytelling. India Today said the songs were not just background, but essential to the film’s meaning, highlighting tracks like “Zamaana Lage” and “Aur Mohabbat Kitni Karoon.” Bollywood Hungama called “Dhaagena Tinak Dhin” a fun and catchy number.[[18]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-IndiaToday-18)[[23]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-BH-23)\\n\\nThe first half of the movie was seen as funny, heartwarming, and enjoyable. Times Now appreciated its light and relatable take on relationships. But the second half was criticized for slowing down and leaving some storylines incomplete. The Hollywood Reporter India said it lacked impact in the second half, and Rediff.com called it a “meandering mess.”[[24]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-TimesNow-24)[[25]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-HRI-25)[[22]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-Rediff-22)\\n\\nThe film was also praised for touching on modern issues like infidelity, abortion, and LGBTQIA+ topics. Filmfare gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling Anurag Basu’s storytelling “honest and thoughtful.” Bollywood Hungama gave it 4 out of 5, calling it a “unique and refreshing musical film.”[[26]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-Filmfare-26)[[27]](https://knowlepedia.org/wiki/Metro..._In_Dino#cite_note-NDTV-27)\\n\\nExternal links\\n--------------\\n\\n*   [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24225606/)\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n1.
